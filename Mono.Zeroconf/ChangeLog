	* Mono.Zeroconf/Service.cs (set_HostTarget): Was still using value
	to look up host; use the stripped hosttarget string instead

2006-02-20  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* Mono.Zeroconf/Service.cs (set_HostTarget): If target ends with .local.,
	strip it before resolving as System.Net.Dns.GetHostByName will fail to
	resolve if there is a VPN connection

	* Mono.Zeroconf: Renamed everything from Mono.ZeroConf to Mono.Zeroconf
	as that's what Apple calls it; cleaned up build system

	* Mono.Zeroconf: First pass at fully-functioning mDNSResponder wrapping;
	it is ready for inclusion in daap-sharp

	* Mono.ZeroConf: Setup to work with mono build system; initial import
	into testing SVN for initial development (abock.org)
