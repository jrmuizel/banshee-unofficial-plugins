	* Abakos/Abakos.Compiler/Functions.cs: Added functions, and E methods;
	functions prints a list of available functions

	* Abakos/Main.cs: Nicer output

	* Abakos: Just a fun little expression parser/evaluator I've started
	writing this weekend after looking with much nostalgia over an old
	version of something similar I implemented in C many years ago; this
	is nothing fantastic, just fun... there's no real use for it and it's
	nothing new
