Known bugs:
	* If the alarm timer goes off and you are not paused in a song, gstreamer pops up an error about being unable to play (null).  What should we do about this?
	* If the alarm is going off, you can't pause within the same minute because the alarm thread runs play each run for the entire minute :/
	* UI niceness.  We know.
	* Volume fade out on alarm does not work
	* --enable-user-plugin does not work right since we're installing a gconf schema for alarm keys.  anyone know a workaround?
	* Sleep Timer - window width doesn't allow title on my box
