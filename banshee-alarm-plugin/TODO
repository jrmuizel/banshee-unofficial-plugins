Global:
	* UI love
		* volumes - sliders!  live volume check.
		* Menu items - check box next to when enabled.

Sleep Timer:
	* Volume fade out / fade out till end of track? just stop at end of track? hmm...
	* Uses glib timer - is this smart?
	* Write sleep time to gconf and resume on startup?  would this defeat the purpose as the time will not be preserved?
	* Split some stuff into other files - make Plugin.cs shorter
	* right now it seeks to the beginning of the track before pausing - so when your alarm goes off in the morning, you are at the beginning of a song.  why doesn't the banshee UI update to show this seek?

Alarm:
	* Alarm thread executes once per second, 24/7.  Is this smart?  Better way to do this?
	* ConfigPage rename to ConfigDialog
	* ConfigPage & Alarm thread - how they access plugin - keep them in same namespace and no plugin referencing - just make classes public.
	* enable/disable checkbox
