Global:
	* UI love
		* volumes - sliders!  live volume check.
		* Menu items - check box next to when enabled.
	* Consider putting alarm/sleep set windows into dialogs, so the wm will center them in the app?

Sleep Timer:
	* Evaluate sleep timer fade out - is this what we want?  It fades out till the end of track, and then pauses.
	* Uses GLib timer - is this smart?
	* Write sleep time to gconf and resume on startup?  would this defeat the purpose as the time will not be preserved?
	* Split some stuff into other files - make Plugin.cs shorter

Alarm:
	* Alarm thread executes once per second, 24/7.  Is this smart?  Better way to do this?  GLib timer?
	* ConfigPage rename to ConfigDialog
	* ConfigPage & Alarm thread - how they access plugin - keep them in same namespace and no plugin referencing - just make classes public.
	* enable/disable checkbox
