Global:
    * UI love
        * volumes - sliders!  live volume check.
        * Menu items - check box next to when enabled.

Sleep Timer:
    * Evaluate sleep timer fade out - is this what we want?  It fades out till the end of track, and then pauses.
    * Split some stuff into other files - make Plugin.cs shorter

Alarm:
    * Alarm thread executes once per second, 24/7.  Is this smart?  Better way to do this?  GLib timer?
    * ConfigPage & Alarm thread - how they access plugin - keep them in same namespace and no plugin referencing - just make classes public.
