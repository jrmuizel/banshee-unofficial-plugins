	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilder.cs: Move standard operators and
	filters here from QueryBuilderModel.cs.  Modify QueryFilter (was
	QueryFilterOperation) to work with multiple-widget inputs (like an entry
	with a dropdown).  Make the input widgets not expand to fill, and pack the
	+/- buttons at the end so they stay right-aligned.  Use Catalog.GetString
	for all GUI strings.  And finally, added necessary logic to reconstruct
	edit dialog from saved Smart Playlists.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Changes to make QueryMatch
	objects work with multiple-widget inputs.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Modify Insert statement so that
	null values get inserted as nulls, not empty strings.
