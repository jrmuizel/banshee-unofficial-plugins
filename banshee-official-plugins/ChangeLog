	resources and debug info where necessary.

2006-05-14  Lukas Lipka  <lukas@pmad.net>

	* plugins/Recommendation/RecommendationPlugin.cs: Hide the recommendation
	pane when the active source changes.

2006-05-11  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	since 0.11.x is now built with gmcs and uses .NET 2.0 libraries; 0.10.x
	compatible plugins will be built with mcs/.NET 1.0 if a 0.10.x Banshee
	is detected

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Delay refreshing the current members unless the
	Library is loaded.  Fix some event triggers so that the track view is
	actually updated.

	* plugins/Podcast/DownloadCore/DownloadCore.cs: Fixed user event

	against Banshee 0.10.x (first plugin API revision)

	* plugins/Radio/RadioSource.cs: conditionally decide whether to use

2006-05-04  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Do not try to override Delete;

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylistPlugin.cs: Moved to Plugin.cs
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylistEditor.cs: Moved to Editor.cs

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilder.cs: Start the query builder with the
	matchCheckBox checked by default.  Add some widget shortcuts.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/smart-playlist.glade: Add widget shortcut for
	name entry, make editor window not resizable.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Add Most/Least Recently
	Played as a "selected by" option, make number spin entries width = 4 so
	year and other number fit.  Add minutes as option for relative date
	conditions.  Use Catalog.GetString for condition field names and add Path,
	Year, and rename Number of Plays to Play Count.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Plugin.cs:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Editor.cs:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Instead of wrapping a
	PlaylistSource, subclass Banshee.Sources.Source, which allows for editing
	via the "Source Properties" menu option, a custom icon, disallowing 
	adding/removing tracks.  Also, use our own SmartPlaylistEntries table
	instead of the PlaylistEntries table. Actually showing the tracks in a smart
	playlist is currently broken/flakey.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Makefile.am: Update with renamed source files,
	add icon to resources list.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/source-smart-playlist.png: New file.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilder.cs: Move standard operators and
	filters here from QueryBuilderModel.cs.  Modify QueryFilter (was
	QueryFilterOperation) to work with multiple-widget inputs (like an entry
	with a dropdown).  Make the input widgets not expand to fill, and pack the
	+/- buttons at the end so they stay right-aligned.  Use Catalog.GetString
	for all GUI strings.  And finally, added necessary logic to reconstruct
	edit dialog from saved Smart Playlists.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Changes to make QueryMatch
	objects work with multiple-widget inputs.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Modify Insert statement so that
	null values get inserted as nulls, not empty strings.

	* plugins/MiniMode/MiniModeWindow.cs: Fixed to not rely on core Banshee
	assembly, small code cleanup
