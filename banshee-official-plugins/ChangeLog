	* configure.ac: Bump version to 0.11.0 to be on par with Banshee HEAD;
	added necessary output files for AssemblyInfo.cs; define BANSHEE_0_10
	if pluginapi < 2

	* plugins/MiniMode/AssemblyInfo.cs.in:
	* plugins/Recommendation/AssemblyInfo.cs.in:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/AssemblyInfo.cs.in:
	* plugins/Radio/AssemblyInfo.cs.in: Added assembly version metadata

	* plugins/MiniMode/Makefile.am: 
	* plugins/Recommendation/Makefile.am:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Makefile.am:
	* plugins/Radio/Makefile.am: Do not define MCS_FLAGS; define 
	CUSTOM_MCS_FLAGS if more are needed; compile AssemblyInfo.cs

	* plugins/Makefile.am: Do not build SmartPlaylists plugin if building
	against Banshee 0.10.x (first plugin API revision)

	* plugins/Radio/RadioSource.cs: conditionally decide whether to use
	System.Uri or Banshee.Base.SafeUri depending on Banshee version

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Do not try to override Delete;
	fixes broken build, but may not be intended behavior

	* plugins/Recommendation/RecommendationPane.cs: Double-encode '/'
	characters in the artist name b/c Last.fm requires it.

2006-05-03  Gabriel Burt  <gabriel.burt@gmail.com>

	* plugins/Recommendation/Makefile.am: Added reference to System.Web

	* plugins/Recommendation/RecommendationPane.cs: Encode the artist before
	using in URLs. (BGO #340511)

	* plugins/MiniMode/MiniModeWindow.cs: Put shuffle/repeat buttons in same
	state as the main UI has them.  Based on buggy patch from Lukas Lipka.
	:) (BGO #338503)

2006-05-03  Gabriel Burt  <gabriel.burt@gmail.com>

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylistPlugin.cs: Moved to Plugin.cs
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylistEditor.cs: Moved to Editor.cs

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilder.cs: Start the query builder with the
	matchCheckBox checked by default.  Add some widget shortcuts.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/smart-playlist.glade: Add widget shortcut for
	name entry, make editor window not resizable.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Add Most/Least Recently
	Played as a "selected by" option, make number spin entries width = 4 so
	year and other number fit.  Add minutes as option for relative date
	conditions.  Use Catalog.GetString for condition field names and add Path,
	Year, and rename Number of Plays to Play Count.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Plugin.cs:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Editor.cs:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Instead of wrapping a
	PlaylistSource, subclass Banshee.Sources.Source, which allows for editing
	via the "Source Properties" menu option, a custom icon, disallowing 
	adding/removing tracks.  Also, use our own SmartPlaylistEntries table
	instead of the PlaylistEntries table. Actually showing the tracks in a smart
	playlist is currently broken/flakey.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Makefile.am: Update with renamed source files,
	add icon to resources list.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/source-smart-playlist.png: New file.

2006-05-02  Gabriel Burt  <gabriel.burt@gmail.com>

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilder.cs: Move standard operators and
	filters here from QueryBuilderModel.cs.  Modify QueryFilter (was
	QueryFilterOperation) to work with multiple-widget inputs (like an entry
	with a dropdown).  Make the input widgets not expand to fill, and pack the
	+/- buttons at the end so they stay right-aligned.  Use Catalog.GetString
	for all GUI strings.  And finally, added necessary logic to reconstruct
	edit dialog from saved Smart Playlists.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Changes to make QueryMatch
	objects work with multiple-widget inputs.

	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/SmartPlaylist.cs: Modify Insert statement so that
	null values get inserted as nulls, not empty strings.

2006-05-02  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* configure.ac: Added plugin Makefile outputs

	* Makefile.am: Added plugins to SUBDIRS

	* plugins/Makefile.am: Added with conditional SUBDIRS for plugins

	* plugins/MiniMode/Makefile.am:
	* plugins/Radio/Makefile.am:
	* plugins/Recommendation/Makefile.am:
	* plugins/SmartPlaylists/Makefile.am: Updated to work with new build
	system (pluginsdir)

	* plugins/MiniMode/MiniModeWindow.cs: Fixed to not rely on core Banshee
	assembly, small code cleanup

2006-05-02  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* banshee-official-plugins: Initial import of skeleton build system
