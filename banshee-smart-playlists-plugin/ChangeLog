	* TODO: New file listing things that are still incomplete.

	* src/smart-playlist.glade: Set the width/height so the dialog actually
	shows up centered on the parent. Move the already_in_use_label to below
	the query builder widgets.  Left-align the name_entry.

	* src/QueryBuilder.cs: Make the orderComboBox insensitive when the
	limitCheckBox isn't selected, as specifying an order only makes sense if
	you are limiting the playlist.

	* src/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Make string matches case insensitive, fix bug
	with what filter operations were displayed for integer matches.

	* src/SmartPlaylistEditor.cs: Return null instead of "" when no condition
	and/or limit_and_order was specified.

	* src/SmartPlaylists.cs: When checking a track, if the playlist has a
	limit/order to it, take that into account.

	* src/SmartPlaylist.cs: Prepend the Condition with WHERE and AND where
	appropriate.

	* src/SmartPlaylistEditor.cs: Fix bug in destroying the dialog widgets
	before getting information out of them in a thread.

	* src/QueryBuilderModel.cs: Add some more fields.

	Initial import. Requires patch to core, still many bugs.
