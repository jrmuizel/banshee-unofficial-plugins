Things left to do:

- Only display the 'Edit Smart Playlist' context-menu item for Smart Playlists

- Re-populate the Smart Playlist dialog widgets when editing

- Fix minor UI glitch with "already in use" label making things resize

- Allow relative dates for date matching to allow for playlists like 
  "Songs with Rating = 5 that I haven't listened to for 3 weeks"

- Add pretty-stars widget for entering matches based on rating
