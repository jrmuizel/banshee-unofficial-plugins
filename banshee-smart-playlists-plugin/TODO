Things left to do:

BUGS:
- Only display the 'Edit Smart Playlist' context-menu item for Smart Playlists

- Re-populate the Smart Playlist dialog widgets when editing (work started)

- Fix minor UI glitch with "already in use" label making things resize

- Make sure things are translatable (mostly done)

- Make limiting the size of a playlist by play time work

- Fix UI bug where adding more match rows doesn't expand the dialog window

ENHANCEMENTS:
- Allow relative dates for date matching to allow for playlists like 
  "Songs with Rating = 5 that I haven't listened to for 3 weeks"

- Add pretty-stars widget for entering matches based on rating
