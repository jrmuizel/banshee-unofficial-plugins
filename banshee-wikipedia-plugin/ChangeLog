	* Little Bugfix, because plugin wasn't getting the song change if the artist didn't change
	* Reorganized Plugin Structure
	* Added artist and genre Lookup using google's "i'm feeling lucky" and specific keywords
	* Added buttons for request and some images on the interface
	* Created one class per requset (artist, genre,album,etc) to provide specific information as query url 
	* Added Regex and a Xpath based parser for Wikipedia pages ( xpath one seems buggy?)
	* Added Request specific decorator for displaying results based on the current gtk-theme colors

	* Google search mode - uses the "i'm feeling lucky" feature of Google to direct to the closes match using Google, adding the keyword "band".  I know, this isn't the best way, but it is much much more accurate than just searching for the artist keyword.
	* Experimenting with stuff like a status bar and progress bar for loading.
		* Progress bar is way too buggy and causes segfaults - commented out :)
	* Opens to about:blank, not google on init.  Faster.
	* Made default size a bit bigger.  Maybe this should be a percentage someday.  Someone patch this for me!
	* Bunch of attempts to create a HPaned between the track listing and this, but I can't find a widget.  Big chunk of commented code for now.
	* Added Wikipedia.dll.config, a DLL mapper copied from gecko-sharp.  Should fix issues with not finding gtkmozembed.so on some platforms. (Send bug reports!)
	* Debug info is copied in, so you can easily trace

	* initial hack
	* most of code borrowed from Fredrik Hedberg - Thanks Fredrik!  just do a `diff RecommendationPlugin.cs Plugin.cs` and you'll see how little I did over there...
	* and of course, thanks to Aaron Bockover for the banshee-sample-plugin framework, as it rocks :)
