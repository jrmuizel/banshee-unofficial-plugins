* change the name of the plugin to something like Context information
* handle links
	* inside wikipedia maybe using wikipediacommonquery
	* outside ->opening in browser 
	* or just opening all links in browser
* auto detect disambig pages somehow?
* search within all the categories for music groups so we're 99% sure we'll get the right one, and not a disambig or a random article
	* use one of the external wikipedia indexing engines?  is there one for music?
* find a skin that doesn't show the left side of wikipedia, or hide it somehow on client side.
* initial size should be 50% (or maybe 33%?) of MainContainer's current size.
	* Grab from Gdk Allocation, calculate when creating the widget, pass as parameter, and groovy. 
* gecko-sharp detection in configure.ac (not just a -pkg flag!)

there's always more to do :)
