* change the name of the plugin to something like Context information
* handle links
	* inside wikipedia maybe using wikipediacommonquery
	* outside ->opening in browser 
	* or just opening all links in browser
* auto detect disambig pages somehow?
* search within all the categories for music groups so we're 99% sure we'll get the right one, and not a disambig or a random article
	* use one of the external wikipedia indexing engines?  is there one for music?
* make resizeable, and save size to gconf

there's always more to do :)
