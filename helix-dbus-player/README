helix-dbus-player is made up of two main components:

hxplayer and hxmessage: a simple C/GLib wrapper on top of Helix's
hxclientkit API that consolidates hxclientkit events into a single
message API and offers full playback functionality. It also handles
threading and engine pumping

helix-dbus-server exposes hxplayer and hxmessage over DBus, allowing
full control of the Helix player and the propagation of hxmessages over
the 'Message' signal

Additionally, a C#/Mono client implementation is provided: Helix.RemotePlayer
