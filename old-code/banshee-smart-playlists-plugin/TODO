BUGS:
- Re-populate the Smart Playlist dialog widgets when editing (work started)

- Fix minor UI glitch with "already in use" label making things resize

- Fix UI bug where adding more match rows doesn't expand the dialog window

- Only display the 'Edit Smart Playlist' context-menu item for Smart Playlists

- Don't show smart playlists in songs' context menu (Add to Playlist) 

- Ignore songs dnd'd onto smart playlists

- Remove "Remove Song" option from songs' context menu for smart playlists

- Trigger periodic recheck of smart playlists that depend on relative dates (every 15 minutes?)

ENHANCEMENTS:
- Add pretty-stars widget for entering matches based on rating

- Ability to use presence in another playlist as a condition. (Just non-smart playlists to prevent recursion?)

- Add nice minute/second entry boxes for duration conditions.

- Ability to limit the size of a playlist by play time (perhaps by taking the average song duration
  and calculating the approximate number of songs required to fill the time slot requested).  Wouldn't work well
  if also ordered or required the songs to be of non-average duration.  Can do the brute force way, checking the
  sum of the duration frequently..would be much slower than the current way of maintaining the track membership of
  a smart playlist.
