What is Abakos?

	Just a fun little expression parser/evaluator I've started
	writing this weekend after looking with much nostalgia over an old
	version of something similar I implemented in C many years ago; this
	is nothing fantastic, just fun... there's no real use for it and it's
	nothing new

Why?

	Because I was bored and this kind of problem entertains me
