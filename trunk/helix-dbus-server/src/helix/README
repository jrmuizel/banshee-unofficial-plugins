Before building, a clean checkout of hxclientkit must be created in
this directory. If your Helix build environment is properly set up,
simply run `build' in this directory, and configure with the following:

  BIF Branch: hxclient_1_5_0_cayenne
  Target:     player_hxclientkit
  Profile:    helix-client-all-defines
